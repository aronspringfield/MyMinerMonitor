# MyMinerMonitor
A small light-weight app for remotely monitoring Crypto Miners using mining pool statistics monitoring. 

This was a project to meet my own needs to monitor my miners that would auto-hop between different mining pools. This app acted as an aggregator to quickly and easily see combined stats, activity and mining performance. 

This app was built-up slowly, and still needed a fair bit of work to be a 'finished product'. Unfortunately, I dismantled my Miner so there was no longer a need for me to continue working on this project. 

# This app hasn't actually been updated since 2018!
